\section{Quantifying Radiation}
\subsection{Flux \& Intensity}
Recalling from \textit{Introduction to Astrophysics \& Cosmology} we define the energy flux density (or simply flux), $F$ as the power per unit surface area.
%
$$ dE = FdAdt $$
%
Note that flux is dependant on the orientation of the unit surface with respect to the Poynting vector of the radiation field.
 Flux has units of J/s/m$^2$.
 Often it is more useful to use the \emph{monochromatic} energy flux density, $F_\nu$ where
%
$$ dE = F_\nu dAdTd\nu. $$
%
This gives the energy flux per unit of bandwidth, (frequency interval of radiation) which has units J/s/m$^2$/Hz.
